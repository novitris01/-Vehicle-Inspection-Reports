# Vehicle-Inspection-Reports
 Vehicle Inspection Reports Pipeline

Project Purpose:
This project aims to create an analytics dashboard for a vehicle fleet inspection agency. The dashboard will show insights into how vehicle inspections are conducted among different client organizations. Instead of directly accessing the client's vehicle inspection tracking database (due to access restrictions and resource limitations), we will work with monthly dumps of vehicle inspection report (VIR) records. These dumps contain enough information to infer details about the vehicles being inspected and the client organizations that own them.

Our main objective is to process these dumps and store the data separately so that we can answer important questions about vehicle distribution, inspection patterns, and pass rates for each client organization. This information will help the agency make informed decisions and gain a better understanding of inspection trends across its clients.
